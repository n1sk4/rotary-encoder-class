# Rotary encoder

Rotary encoder class in C++ 
===========================
About
-----
Basic steper rotary encoder with two interrupts.

Rotary encoder
--------------
This electronic component is used to sense the rotational movement that is converted into series of pulses.
There are two types of rotary encoders: Absolute and incremental. Absolute knows at which perticular angle 
it's set and the incremental can only add or subcract it's value that must be stored somewhere.
The class is based on an incremental type of rotary encoder that uses three pins for rotary movement and one for the switch.
